# Contributing

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data
Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) are open source projects, and we welcome
contributions of all kinds: new lessons, fixes to existing material, bug
reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our
license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess
your change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our
community. Everyone involved in [Software
Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data
Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) agrees to abide by our [code of
conduct](CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling
mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to
introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1.  If you do not have a [GitHub](http://github.com) account, you can [send us
    comments by email](mailto:admin@software-carpentry.org). However, we will be
    able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described
    below.

2.  If you have a [GitHub](http://github.com) account, or are willing to [create
    one](https://github.com/join), but do not know how to use Git, you can
    report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an
    issue](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/issues/). This allows us
    to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3.  If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,
    you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are
    [included below](#using-github).

Note: if you want to build the website locally, please refer to [The Workbench
documentation](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/).

## Where to Contribute

1.  If you wish to change this lesson, add issues and PR here.\
2.  If you wish to change the template used for workshop websites, please refer
    to [The Workbench documentation](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/).

## What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and improving
existing ones to updating or filling in the documentation and submitting [bug
reports](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/issues/) about things that
don't work, aren't clear, or are missing. If you are looking for ideas, please
see [the list of issues for this
repository](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/issues/), or the issues
for [Data Carpentry](https://github.com/issues?q=user%3Adatacarpentry) and
[Software Carpentry](https://github.com/issues?q=user%3Aswcarpentry) projects.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are
smarter together than we are on our own. **Reviews from novices and newcomers
are particularly valuable**: it's easy for people who have been using these
lessons for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so
fresh eyes are always welcome.

## What *Not* to Contribute

Our lessons already contain more material than we can cover in a typical
workshop, so we are usually *not* looking for more concepts or tools to add to
them. As a rule, if you want to introduce a new idea, you must (a) estimate how
long it will take to teach and (b) explain what you would take out to make room
for it. The first encourages contributors to be honest about requirements; the
second, to think hard about priorities.

We are also not looking for exercises or other material that only run on one
platform. Our workshops typically contain a mixture of Windows, macOS, and Linux
users; in order to be usable, our lessons must run equally well on all three.

## Using GitHub {#using-github}

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on
GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
In brief, we use [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to
manage changes:

1.  Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each
    significant change.
2.  Commit the change in that branch.
3.  Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4.  Submit a pull request from that branch to the [master repository][repo].
5.  If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your
    branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.

NB: The published copy of the lesson is usually in the `main` branch.

Each lesson has two maintainers who review issues and pull requests or encourage
others to do so. The maintainers are community volunteers, and have final say
over what gets merged into the lesson.

## Other Resources

General discussion of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) happens on the [discussion mailing
list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/listinfo/discuss), which everyone is
welcome to join. You can also [reach us by
