## What is data science

Over the last decade, several tools, methods and training resources have been developed for early career researchers to learn about and apply data science skills in biomedicine.
This is often referred to as biomedical data science, with the following definition.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  testimonial

Biosciences and biomedical researchers regularly combine mathematics and computational methods to interpret experimental data. The term "data science" describes expertise associated with taking (usually large) data sets and annotating, cleaning, organizing, storing, and analyzing them for the purposes of extracting knowledge. [...]
The terms "biomedical data science" and "biomedical data scientist" [...] connote activities associated with the creation and application of methods to new and large sources of biological and medical data aimed at converting them into useful information and knowledge.
They also connote technical activities that are data-intensive and require special skills in managing the large, noisy, and complex data typical of biology and medicine.
They may also imply the application of these technologies in domains where their collaborators previously have not needed data-intensive computational approaches.

\-- Russ B. Altman and Michael Levitt (2018). [Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-bd-01-041718-100001)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In contrast to the definition above (and as will be explained in the next chapters), we think research which is not data intensive would also gain in applying data science principles.
However, to ensure that data science approaches are appropriately applied in domain research, such as in biosciences, there is a need to also engage and educate scientific group leaders and researchers in project leadership roles on best practices.
Computational methods might indeed be as complex as a neural network, but even statistical tests and producing figures for a publication require data science and coding methods.

Researcher use data science skills to apply computation techniques and reproducible data analyses approaches to their research questions.
In order to apply these tools, researcher first need to understand and apply the building blocks of data science, especially research data management, collaborative working and project management.

In some instances, it has been argued that "data science" simply rebrands existing fields like statistics or computer science.
Our view is that data science has gained traction as an overarching term due to increased data availability and complexity; development of computational methods; advances in computational infrastructure; growing concerns about scientific rigor and the reproducibility of research findings; and a recognition that new advances will result from interdisciplinary research and collaboration.
These trends are not unique to data science, but their integration and consolidation under a single term, however broad, reflects an understanding of their interconnectedness and is a real shift in the scientific landscape

With new technologies supporting the generation of large-scale data as well as successful applications of data science, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biomedicine and related fields have recently shown huge potential to transform the way we conduct research.
Recent groundbreaking research utilising AI technologies in biomedicine has led to an enormous interest among researchers in data science, ML and AI approach to extract useful insights from big data, make new discoveries and address biological questions.
As pictured below, in order to apply these tools, researcher first need to understand and apply the building blocks of data science, especially research data management, collaborative working and project management.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  discussion

In what aspects of your projects do you already apply computational and statistical approaches?
Do you consider data science relevant for your project? Why/Why not?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The [**Data Science for Biomedical Scientists**](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience) project helps address this need in training by equipping experimental biomedical scientists with essential computational skills.
In all the resources developed within this project, we consistently emphasise how computational and data science approaches can be applied while ensuring reproducibility, collaboration and transparent reporting.

**The goal is to maintain the highest standards of research practice and integrity**.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this training material for learning how to manage computational projects, we discuss essential practices for computational reproducibility required for carrying out meaningful analyses of research datasets through data exploration, processing, visualisation and communication.
We present unfamiliar and complex topics from computation and data science to biologists by providing examples and recommendations from their fields.
The goal is to enable effective management and sharing of their computational projects. We therefore encourage you to go through this training material before taking our second workshop, more focused in AI and Data Science.
